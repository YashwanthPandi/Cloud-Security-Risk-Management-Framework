## Introduction
This project focuses on designing a comprehensive framework to assess and mitigate security risks in cloud environments. It provides guidelines and practical implementations to secure cloud infrastructures using AWS, Azure, or GCP.

## Objective
Create a risk management framework tailored for cloud environments, incorporating best practices for security, compliance, and governance.

## Key Features
- **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**: Deploy sample cloud environments using AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- **IAM Policies**: Implement robust Identity and Access Management policies.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform automated vulnerability scans on cloud resources.
- **Compliance Assessment**: Evaluate compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **IAM Tools**: AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: AWS Inspector, Prisma Cloud
- **Compliance Tools**: CIS Benchmarks, AWS Config

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Accounts on AWS, Azure, or GCP
- CLI tools installed for your chosen cloud platform
- Python 3.x

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-security-framework.git
    cd cloud-security-framework
    ```

2. **Set Up Cloud Infrastructure**
    - Follow the instructions in the `infrastructure` directory to deploy sample resources.
    - Example for AWS using CloudFormation:
        ```bash
        aws cloudformation deploy --template-file aws_template.yaml --stack-name cloud-security-stack
        ```

3. **Configure IAM Policies**
    - Navigate to the `iam` directory.
    - Apply predefined IAM policies:
        ```bash
        python iam_setup.py
        ```

4. **Perform Vulnerability Scans**
    - Use AWS Inspector or Prisma Cloud to scan deployed resources.
    - Example using AWS Inspector:
        ```bash
        aws inspector start-assessment-run --assessment-template-arn your_template_arn
        ```

5. **Compliance Assessment**
    - Use CIS Benchmarks to evaluate compliance.
    - Example using AWS Config:
        ```bash
        aws configservice start-config-rule-evaluation --config-rule-name cis-aws-foundations-benchmark
        ```

## Usage

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**
    - Execute deployment scripts to set up cloud resources.
    - Ensure all services are running correctly.

2. **Manage IAM Policies**
    - Review and modify IAM policies as needed.
    - Assign appropriate roles and permissions to users and services.

3. **Run Vulnerability Scans**
    - Schedule regular scans to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    - Review scan reports and implement remediation steps.

4. **Assess Compliance**
    - Continuously monitor compliance with industry standards.
    - Generate compliance reports and address any non-compliance issues.

## Outcome
- **Cloud Security Expertise**: Gain practical knowledge in securing cloud environments.
- **Risk Management Skills**: Develop the ability to assess and mitigate security risks.
- **Compliance Knowledge**: Understand and implement compliance frameworks and standards.
- **Automation**: Utilize cloud-native tools for automated security and compliance checks.
